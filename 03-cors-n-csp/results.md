# cors-n-csp

quite impressive overall, very advanced PoC.  the PoC itself in terms of code is probably AI-generated (?) but result is there and seems to work.

- good trick with all vhosts/origins on same machine, and documented
- good you are dissecting the behviours of cors within the browser
- good you are dissecting the behviours of csp within the browser

guys I don't know what to say.  there is very little room for me to criticize anything.

the only thing that I could find missing is about mixed mode (slide 6):
normal mode and nonce-mode should be able to work together,
because there is usually external JS code to handle and also possibly just a few ones inline,
that can't be removed for some reason.  It cannot be either-or.  Both can work in tandem.

also the consequence of having a full-blown and dynamic interface for testing use-cases makes it harder to read.  Having Minimal Working Examples (MWE) is sometimes preferable.
